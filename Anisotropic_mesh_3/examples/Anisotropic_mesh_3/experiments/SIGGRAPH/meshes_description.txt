==========================================================

--Implicit surfaces--

.Chairs :
	 .Good looking mesh of an implicit surface endowed with a curvature metric field.
	 .The algorithm deals with parabolic points, whatever the direction of the vanishing curvature is.
	 .High-ish number of points (60k) without problems.
	 .More technical : influence of the epsilon parameter on the final mesh (approximation error is constant for both meshes),
	the mesher can honor curves of parabolic points with very high anisotropy if that is desired (so called over-refinement).

.Ellipsoids :
	 .The two ellipsoids have the same number of points and the approximation is constant. Since the bigger
	one has 10 times the surface area, it shows the stretching capabilities and also more implicitely the
	good ratio of vertices between an anisotropic and an isotropic mesh of the same surface for a given approximation.
	 .Also shows 1/500 ratio of anisotropy (mesher can go higher than that, but we can't really observe 1/500 + ratios)

.Sphere :
	.This illustrates the use of a custom metric field on an implicit surface by the mesher.

.Torus & cyclid :
	.More or less the same as the others (good looking, parabolic points, decent anisotropy), just different geometries.




--Polyhedral surfaces --

.Helmet and fertility
	.Simple curvature metric field results, good anisotropy, deals with tunnels through the surface and flat regions.

.Elephant
	.Mesher can use a custom metric field or curvature related metric field by the mesher on a polyhedral surfaces.




Folder of post-processed meshes
-------------------------------

This folder contains meshes that were toyed a bit with using Polyhedron's simplification/subdivision operations after their
creation with the aniso mesher.

Fertility simpli and subdiv :
	.One simplification of half the edges into subdivion by sqrt(3). Really good looking final mesh, but using a big simplification
	like this is sort of cheating since it creates anisotropy on its own when it removes edges.

Fertility subtle simplification :
	.Removed only 5% of the edges. Goal was to remove only clusters without abusing of simplification's inner anisotropy. Works nicely.
