\begin{ccPkgDescription}{Triangulations\label{Pkg:Triangulations}}

\ccPkgSummary{The package \ccc{Triangulation} provides classes for manipulating
triangulations (pure simplicial complexes) in Euclidean spaces whose
dimension can be specified at compile-time or at run-time. Specifically, it
provides a combinatorial Triangulation data structure, which is extended into
geometric triangulation and Delaunay triangulation classes. Point location and point
insertion are supported. The Delaunay triangulation also supports point removal.}
