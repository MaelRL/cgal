%
\ccPkgSummary{For a surface discretized as a point cloud or a mesh, it
  is desirable to estimate pointwise differential quantities. More
  precisely, first order properties correspond to the normal or the
  tangent plane; second order properties provide the principal
  curvatures and directions, third order properties provide the
  directional derivatives of the principal curvatures along the
  curvature lines, etc. This package allows the estimation of local
  differential quantities of a surface from a point sample.}
