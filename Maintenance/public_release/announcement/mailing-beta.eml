Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.5 Beta 1
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

CGAL version 4.5 Beta 1 is a public testing release. It should provide
a solid ground to report bugs that need to be tackled before the
release of the final version of CGAL 4.5 in October.


Besides fixes to existing packages, the following has changed since
CGALÂ 4.4:

  o Support

    - CMake version 3.0 is now supported.

    - Microsoft Windows Visual C++ compiler 2008 (VC9) is no longer
      supported.


  o Triangulated Surface Mesh Deformation (new package)

    This package allows to deform a triangulated surface mesh under positional
    constraints of some of its vertices without requiring any additional
    structure other than the surface mesh itself. The methods provided
    implements an as-rigid-as-possible deformation.


  o Breaking change in the support of Boost Graph Library
    
   - Introduction of the FaceGraph concept.

   - Cleanup of the HalfedgeGraph concept. In particular:

      - Deprecation of halfedge_graph_traits.

      - A model of HalfedgeGraph is considered as an undirected graph. Thus any
        call to edges() should be replaced by halfedges() and num_edges() now
        returns the number of (undirected) edges.

      - Breaking change: is_border_edge and is_border_halfedge properties are
        removed. The free functions is_border() and is_border_edge() should be
        used instead.


  o 3D Triangulations

    Add an experimental parallel version of the Delaunay triangulation and the
    regular triangulation algorithms, which allows parallel insertion and
    removal of point ranges.


  o 3D Mesh Generation

    Add an experimental parallel version of the 3D mesh refinement and mesh
    optimization methods.

The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations, Delaunay triangulations
  and periodic triangulations in 2D and 3D),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
