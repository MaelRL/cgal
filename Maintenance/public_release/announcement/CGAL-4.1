Subject: CGAL 4.1 Released, Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Body: 

The CGAL Open Source Project is pleased to announce the release 4.1
of CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

Besides fixes to existing packages, the following has changed since
CGAL 4.1:

 o New compiler support

     The Apple Clang compiler versions 3.1 and 3.2 are now supported on
     Mac OS X.


See http://www.cgal.org/releases.html for a complete list of changes.


Note that the release 4.1 of CGAL has known bugs that should be fixed soon
in a future release 4.1.1:

  - The packages "Triangulated Surface Mesh Simplification" and "CGAL and
    the Boost Graph Library" do not compile with Boost versions 1.51 and
    later.


The CGAL project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
easy-to-use, and efficient C++ software library of geometric data
structures and algorithms, like
- triangulations (2D constrained triangulations and Delaunay
  triangulations in 2D and 3D, periodic triangulations),
- Voronoi diagrams (for 2D and 3D points, 2D additively weighted
  Voronoi diagrams, and segment Voronoi diagrams),
- Boolean operations on polygons and polyhedra,
- regularized Boolean operations on polygons with curved arcs
- arrangements of curves,
- mesh generation (2D, 3D and surface mesh generation,
  surface mesh subdivision and parametrization),
- alpha shapes (in 2D and 3D),
- convex hull algorithms (in 2D, 3D and dD),
- operations on polygons (straight skeleton and offset polygon),
- search structures (kd trees for nearest neighbor search, and
  range and segment trees),
- interpolation (natural neighbor interpolation and placement of
  streamlines),
- optimization algorithms (smallest enclosing sphere of points or
  spheres, smallest enclosing ellipsoid of points, principal
  component analysis),
- kinetic data structures
